## Introduction

Climate change is a major challenge humanity is facing, and reducing CO2 emissions is crucial to mitigate its effects. This project aims to raise awareness about the impact of electrical production on CO2 emissions in France. It uses real-time electrical production data to calculate and display the corresponding carbon footprint.

## Required Hardware

To build this device, you will need the following components:

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)
- A set of LEDs (e.g., RGB LEDs)
- Resistors and wires to connect the LEDs
- USB power supply for the ESP8266
- Internet access to fetch electrical production data

## Setup

Ensure you connect the LEDs to the ESP8266 as per the wiring diagram provided in the "schematics" folder. You can customize the setup based on your requirements.

## Configuration

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your computer.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/co2-electrical-production-france.git# CO2_EMISION_ELEC_PRODUCTION
